          The Clipperton Island Yacht Club (CIYC) serves as a virtual gathering
          place for individuals who share a love and respect for Clipperton
          Island.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black mb-3">
          Our vision is to build a community that appreciates the island's
          unique ecosystem, historical significance, and French sovereignty. The
          club dedicates itself to preserving the island's environment and
          minimizing any negative impact on its delicate ecosystem. As
          responsible members, we pledge to report any sightings, findings, or
          observations related to the eco-system or fishing activities to the
          French authorities at the High Commissary of French Polynesia.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black mb-3">
          At CIYC, like-minded individuals can come together to admire the
          island's natural beauty, delve into its historical heritage, and
          engage in activities aligned with our conservation goals. Those who
          wish to visit the island must earn access to its beaches, showcasing
          its exceptional history and ecosystem, as well as participating in
          ocean-based activities such as eco-diving and eco-fishing. Located
          approximately five days by sea from Acapulco, Puerto Vallarta, or
          Cabo, Clipperton Island lacks landing and living infrastructure,
          making it a challenging place to reach and reside.
        </p>
        <p className="text-black mb-3">
          The yacht club's commitment to sustainability and environmental
          stewardship serves as a model for responsible eco-tourism. We want to
          demonstrate that it is possible to enjoy the island's natural beauty
          without causing harm to its delicate ecosystem. By fostering a
          community of individuals who share a passion for Clipperton Island's
          unique ecosystem, culture and history, the club ensures that the
          island remains a cherished and preserved destination for future
          generations.
